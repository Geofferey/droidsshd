It additionally includes
- a sftp-server posted by rgeorgi@gmail.com in http://code.google.com/p/droidsshd/issues/detail?id=1
- ported bugfixes by Tanguy Pruvot <tanguy.pruvot@gmail.com> from https://github.com/tpruvot/android_external_droidsshd
  (more try/catch, service startup, released boot receiver, status management)
  but preserved the dropbear binaries and related code from https://github.com/mestre/droidsshd
- a service intent "stop"
  Now KebabApps' Llama can start/stop the service depending on location profiles:
  Choose "custom intent", "start service", package "br.com.bott.droidsshd", class "br.com.bott.droidsshd.system.DroidSSHdService".
  To stop the server add data "stop", to start it leave data empty.
